  "aboutFull": "Founded by book lovers and design enthusiasts, BiblioDesign was born from a simple observation: books are both intellectual treasures and design elements. Yet most homes either lack books entirely or display mismatched collections that clash with their interiors.\n\nWe believe every home deserves a library that reflects both the personality of its inhabitants and the aesthetic of the space. Our team combines expertise in interior design, literature, and art history to create collections that are as visually stunning as they are intellectually stimulating.",
  "mission": "To transform living spaces through the timeless beauty of thoughtfully curated books, creating personal libraries that inspire, educate, and elevate.",
